# Indexing System

## Overview
The Indexing System is a production-ready distributed indexing solution designed for high performance and scalability. It features advanced security, observability, and operational management capabilities.

## Features
- **Distributed Indexing**: Efficiently indexes and searches large datasets with sharding and bloom filters.
- **Security**: Implements JWT authentication and role-based access control.
- **Observability**: Uses Prometheus for metrics and OpenTelemetry for tracing.
- **Modern UI**: Provides a GUI for real-time monitoring and control.
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.
